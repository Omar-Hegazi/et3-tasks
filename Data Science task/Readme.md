## Introduction
This folder containes my solution to data science tasks and screenshots of the results.

## Description
In my solution, I imported data from drinkMenu.csv file. I explored the data to get an intuation of what's inside then I checked for duplicates on row level.
I then searched for null values there was only one null value in the data then I droped the unnecessary columns to the required analysis therefor I didn't 
get into much preperation of the unnecessary columns. I started to vizualize the data to answer the questions. It appears that White Chocolate Mocha (Without Whipped Cream)
has the highest calories and Java Chip (Without Whiped Cream) has the highest suger.
